1. PRIMARY PURPOSE: Clearly state the main functionality these files collectively implement (1-2 sentences).
2. ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS:
   - Describe the key architectural patterns used (e.g., MVC, layered, modular).
   - Explain how components, services, or modules are structured and interact.
   - Mention any significant libraries or frameworks leveraged.
3. DATA FLOW & STATE MANAGEMENT:
   - Explain how data flows between components, services, and/or APIs.
   - Note how state is managed (e.g., global/local state, context, Redux, props).
4. ROUTING & NAVIGATION:
   - Describe how routing is configured and how navigation between pages/components works.
   - Mention any protected routes, dynamic routes, or nested route handling.
5. CORE FUNCTIONS & LOGIC:
   - List the main functional responsibilities and what core logic each part handles.
   - Highlight any custom hooks, utilities, middleware, or backend integrations.
6. TECHNICAL INSIGHTS:

Your goal is to help engineers, tech leads, and system architects understand not just *what* this codebase does, but *how* it works internallyâ€”its structure, logic flow, and systemic behaviors.

  ðŸ§  Use analytical reasoning and architectural thinking to:
  - Extract how different layers/modules interact and what responsibilities they encapsulate.
  - Uncover how data flows between components, APIs, and external systems.
  - Identify implicit contracts, control flows, and real-time data processing strategies.
  - Highlight implementation trade-offs, maintainability concerns, or technical bottlenecks.
  - Infer security posture, testing strategies, scalability limits, and modularity levels.
  
  ðŸ’¡ Assume your audience has technical depth and seeks:
  - **Non-obvious insights** about how the system behaves under load or edge cases.
  - Understanding of how core functions work *end-to-end*, not just high-level overviews.
  - Reasoning about scalability, flexibility, data consistency, and code quality.
  
  ðŸ“Œ Format your response using the following **EXACT structure**. Each section should contain **2â€“3 focused and technically meaningful bullet points**, using formal, precise language. Avoid repetition or vague generalizations.
  
  ---
  
  **Overall Architecture**
  - Describe the high-level system architecture (monolith, modular, service-based, SSR/CSR mix, etc.)
  - Identify how responsibilities are distributed across layers or modules (e.g., presentation, business logic, persistence).
  
  **Main Components / Services**
  - Highlight critical services/modules, their roles, and how they interoperate.
  - Mention any separation of concerns or communication interfaces between them (e.g., service APIs, shared utilities, event buses).
  
  **Database Usage**
  - Explain how persistent data is managed, including schema design approaches or ORMs.
  - Describe how the data layer interacts with the business logic layer, and any observable consistency or transactional guarantees.
  
  **API Design & Integration Points**
  - Discuss how external/internal APIs are designed (REST, GraphQL, RPC), and how integration is handled.
  - Mention key endpoint patterns, request/response structure, and inter-service communication protocols.
  
  **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Identify auth mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, sessions), and where/when validation occurs in the stack.
  - Explain how access control is enforced (RBAC, ABAC, route guards, middleware).
  
  **Notable Patterns or Frameworks**
  - Mention recognized architectural or design patterns (MVC, CQRS, repository, observer, etc.).
  - Highlight how framework usage influences code structure (e.g., React hooks, Express middleware, Prisma models).
  
  **Data Flow & State Management**
  - Describe how data flows across components, functions, or layersâ€”including unidirectional/bidirectional flows.
  - Explain state handling mechanisms (props/context, client-side state, server-side caching, reactive updates, etc.).
  - Highlight how data is fetched, transformed, and passed through the system end-to-end.
  
  **Important Functions & Business Logic**
  - Identify the most important functions or handlers and what business-critical logic they encapsulate.
  - Explain the control flow, decision-making logic, or branching behavior that drives application outcomes.
  
  **Error Handling & Resilience**
  - Describe how errors are caught, logged, or surfacedâ€”both client- and server-side.
  - Note retry logic, fallbacks, graceful degradation, or circuit-breaker patterns.
  
  **Code Vulnerabilities & Security Concerns**
  - Point out any possible security weaknesses (e.g., hardcoded secrets, unchecked inputs, unguarded endpoints).
  - Mention how input validation, sanitization, and secure coding practices are implemented (or missing).
  
  **Performance Considerations**
  - Identify areas where caching, batching, lazy loading, or debouncing is used for optimization.
  - Mention any potential bottlenecks in data-heavy loops, API call chains, or database queries.
  
  **Testing & Quality Assurance**
  - Describe unit/integration/e2e testing practices, coverage approaches, or mock strategies.
  - Point out if testability is enhanced by design (e.g., dependency injection, interface separation).
  
  **Deployment & Infrastructure**
  - Explain deployment approach (CI/CD, container orchestration, static builds).
  - Note how environments are managed (e.g., dotenv configs, feature flags, infra-as-code).
  
  **Improvement Opportunities**
  - Suggest areas for modularization, better abstraction, or refactoring for clarity/performance.
  - Highlight quick wins for observability, scalability, or architectural cleanliness.
  
  **Technical Debt Assessment**
  - Call out complex, brittle, or over-coupled areas that may cause maintenance pain.
  - Mention anti-patterns or inconsistencies that reflect rushed or legacy code.
  
  **Documentation Quality**
  - Evaluate the clarity and completeness of comments, README, API docs, and onboarding guides.
  - Point out where lack of documentation may hinder new developers or future scaling.
